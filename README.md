# Image-Detection-with-Python-and-Arduino-Alarm
Python and Arduino Image Detection - Alarm
. This project aims to warn about a maritime oil accident.
. I used OpenCv as the main library for this project.
. The use of image processing was not good a lot because the main idea of his project is to alarm by integrating Arduino and Pyhton with the Proteus simulator.
. I used for identification of the oil the black color.
