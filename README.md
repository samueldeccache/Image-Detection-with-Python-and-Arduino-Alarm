# Image-Detection-with-Python-and-Arduino-Alarm
Python and Arduino Image Detection - Alarm
. This project aims to warn about a maritime oil accident.

. I used OpenCv as the main library for this project.

. I used for identification of the oil the black color. 

. I used at circuit a led as alarm and arduino as a microcontroller. 

. The ideia is use a Raspberry Pi for this integration.
